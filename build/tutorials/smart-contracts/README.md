# Smart Contracts

## Introduction

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche gives you complete control on both the network and application layers&mdash;helping you build anything you can imagine.

Avalanche can do anything a typical Ethereum client can by using the Ethereum-standard RPC calls. The immediate benefits of using the Avalanche rather than Ethereum are speed, scale and throughput. Avalanche offers thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality at inexpensive fees. These properties will considerably improve the performance of DApps and the user experience of smart-contracts.

Here is a collection of tutorials showing how to use and deploy smart contracts on Avalanche with the most popular Ethereum development tools.
