# Getting Started: Run an Avalanche Node

The quickest way to learn about Avalanche is to run a node and interact with the network.

When you send this request, the node will authenticate you using your username and password. Then, it will look through all the [private keys](http://support.avalabs.org/en/articles/4587058-what-are-public-and-private-keys) controlled by your user until it finds enough AVAX to satisfy the request.

The response contains the transactionâ€™s ID. It will be different for every invocation of `send`.

```cpp
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :5,
    "result" :{
        "txID":"2QouvFWUbjuySRxeX5xMbNCuAaKWfbk5FeEa2JmoF85RKLk2dD",
        "changeAddr" :"X-avax1turszjwn05lflpewurw96rfrd3h6x8flgs5uf8"
    }
}
```

#### Checking the Transaction Status

This transaction will only take a second or two to finalize. We can check its status with [`avm.getTxStatus`](avalanchego-apis/exchange-chain-x-chain-api.md#avm-gettxstatus):

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :6,
    "method" :"avm.getTxStatus",
    "params" :{
        "txID":"2QouvFWUbjuySRxeX5xMbNCuAaKWfbk5FeEa2JmoF85RKLk2dD"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

The response should indicate that the transaction was accepted:

```cpp
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :6,
    "result" :{
        "status":"Accepted"
    }
}
```

You might also see that `status` is `Processing` if the network has not yet finalized the transaction.

Once you see that the transaction is `Accepted`, check the balance of the `to` address to see that it has the AVAX we sent:

```cpp
curl -X POST --data '{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :7,
    "method" :"avm.getBalance",
    "params" :{
        "address":"X-avax1w4nt49gyv4e99ldqevy50l2kz55y9efghep0cs",
        "assetID"  :"AVAX"
    }
}' -H 'content-type:application/json;' 127.0.0.1:9650/ext/bc/X
```

The response should be:

```cpp
{
    "jsonrpc":"2.0",
    "id"     :7,
    "result" :{
        "balance":1000
    }
}
```

In the same fashion, we could check `X-avax1xeaj0h9uy7c5jn6fxjp0rg4g39jeh0hl27vf75` to see that AVAX we sent was deducted from its balance, as well as the transaction fee.
